// ----------------------------Chapter 8: GENERICS-----------------------------------------------

/*
The whole idea behind TypeScript is to define strict types for a type-safe developer experience.
To achieve that, we're usually as detailed as possible.
However, TS does allow for GENERICS, because sometimes we simply don't know what types will be 
passed into a function/interface/type alias/class...
Generics allow us to provide a placeholder, a type "variable" if you will.
