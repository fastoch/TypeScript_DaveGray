# Introduction

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that can be used to write frontend code or backend code.  
TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, which makes it available for **React** projects, **Node.js** projects, and more!

---

**Side note**:   
- **React** is a widely-used JS library designed for building user interfaces (frontend), particularly for single-page applications (SPAs).  
- **Node.js** is an open-source JS runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side (backend).

This free 8 hour TypeScript course has 17 chapters and focuses on frontend development with TypeScript.   
It will guide you through learning the TS fundamentals and building two complete projects.  
- Chapters 1-11 are for learning TypeScript fundamentals 
- Chapters 12-17 cover TypeScript with React. 

Save the React chapters until AFTER you have learned React from the course below:

# Chapter 1

Official TypeScript website: https://www.typescriptlang.org/  
TypeScript (TS) is JavaScript (JS) with syntax for **types**.  
It helps you write better JS.  

TS was created by Microsoft.  
TS and C# were both created by the same person named **Anders Hejlberg**.  

In 2024, more than 60% of developers use JS, and almost 40% of them use TS.

## Required Tools

- TS is integrated into Visual Studio Code very nicely.  
- After that, you need **npm**, which you can get by installing **Node.js**
  - npm = Node Package Manager
- That doesn't mean we're going to necessarily write any Node.js, although we could.

## Prerequisites

- open a terminal windows in VS code by pressing Ctrl + J
- assuming you already installed the nodejs package and can now use npm, use the following cmd to install TypeScript:
  - `npm i typescript -g`
  - the `-g` flag is for 'global', which means you want to install a npm module globally

Then, let's create some files in VS code file tree.
