# Introduction

TypeScript is a subset of JavaScript that can be used to write frontend code, and it can also be used to write backend code.  
TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, which makes it available for **React** projects, **Node.js** projects, and more!

**Side note**:   
- **React** is a widely-used JavaScript library designed for building user interfaces (frontend), particularly for single-page applications (SPAs).  
- **Node.js** is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side (backend).
