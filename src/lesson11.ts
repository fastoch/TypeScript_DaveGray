// ------------TS Project for beginners---------------

/*
We'll be building a simple list application.
- add an item to the list
- check items off of the list (checkbox)
- delete an item
- clear the entire list
*/

/*
The first thing you're going to need is Node.js
Run `node -v` to check if already installed. 
On Arch Linux, run `sudo pacman -S nodejs` to install it.
*/

/*
We also need npm (node package manager).
Verify version via `npm -v` and install via `sudo pacman -S npm`.
*/

/*
To start our first TS project we will use Vite.
Open a dedicated empty folder in VS Code. 
Open a terminal window in VS Code and run `npm create vite@latest`.
- Name your project (vite-ts in our case). 
- Choose Vanilla JS
- Then choose TypeScript
- `cd` into your project folder (the one named after your project)
- run `npm install` to install all dependencies listed in your `package.json` file 
- Finally, run `npm run dev` to start your local development server
- you can Ctrl + click on the provided http://localhost:5173/ link to access your minimal Vite app
